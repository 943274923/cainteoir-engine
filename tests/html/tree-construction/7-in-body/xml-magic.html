<!--

	The mimetype entries for HTML and XML both contain a pattern for
	comments. HTML also contains entries for html, head, title, script
	and body elements, but these are scoped between 0..257 characters.
	Thus, this comment is longer than 257 characters to prevent the
	HTML element detection from triggering.

# Experimental Research Projects

This directory contains research projects that are not ready to be integrated
into the Cainteoir Text-to-Speech library. This is mainly because the way it
works and the interaction with the rest of the library has not been figured
out.

Doing this allows for faster iteration times on research projects, until the
item under research is mature enough to be integrated into the main Cainteoir
Text-to-Speech library. This also serves to keep a record of the evolution of
the implementation of the different parts of the Cainteoir Text-to-Speech
library.

Previously, this work was done in the `test` directory. However, as that
contains the code to test the library is working correctly, the experimental
research projects have been moved to this directory.

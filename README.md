----------

The Cainteoir Text-to-Speech engine is a library that provides text-to-speech
functionality for reading and recording different document formats.

## Build Dependencies

In order to build cainteoir-engine, you need:

1.  a functional autotools system (`make`, `autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool`,
    `autopoint` and `pkg-config`);
2.  a functional c++ compiler;
3.  the zlib development libraries;
4.  the shared mime info package.

Optionally, you need:

1.  the pulseaudio development library to enable pulseaudio output;
2.  the alsa development libraries to enable alsa audio output;
3.  the vorbis encoder development libraries for ogg/vorbis support;
4.  the espeak development libraries for espeak support;
5.  the pico development libraries for svox pico support;
6.  the poppler development libraries for pdf support;

To build the documentation, you need:

1.  the pandoc program to build the general documentation;
2.  the doxygen program to build the api documentation;
3.  the dot program to generate graphs in the api documentation.

## Building

The Cainteoir Engine supports the standard GNU autotools build system. The
source code does not contain the generated `configure` files, so to build
it you need to run:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make

The tests can be run by using:

	make check

The program can be installed using:

	sudo make install

The documentation can be built (after installing `pandoc`) using:

	make doc

Source tarballs can be generated by running:

	make dist

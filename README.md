# Cainteoir Text-to-Speech Engine

The Cainteoir Text-to-Speech engine is a library that provides text-to-speech
functionality for reading and recording different document formats.

## Building

The Cainteoir Engine supports the standard GNU autotools build system. The
source code does not contain the generated `configure` files, so to build
it you need to run:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make

The tests can be run by using:

	make check

The program can be installed using:

	sudo make install

The documentation can be built (after installing `pandoc`) using:

	make doc

Source tarballs can be generated by running:

	make dist

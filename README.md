----------

The Cainteoir Text-to-Speech engine is a library that provides text-to-speech
functionality for reading and recording different document formats.

## Build Dependencies

In order to build cainteoir-engine, you need:

1.  a functional autotools system (`make`, `autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool`,
    `autopoint` and `pkg-config`);
2.  a functional c++ compiler;
3.  the Python YAML parser library;
4.  the zlib development libraries;
5.  the shared mime info package.

Optionally, you need:

1.  the pulseaudio development library to enable pulseaudio output;
2.  the alsa development libraries to enable alsa audio output;
3.  the vorbis encoder development libraries for ogg/vorbis support;
4.  the espeak development libraries for espeak support;
5.  the pico development libraries for svox pico support;
6.  the poppler development libraries for pdf support.

If you want ePub 3.0 Media Overlay support, you need FFmpeg or libav v9 or later,
with the following libraries installed:

1.  libavutil;
2.  libavcodec;
3.  libavformat;
4.  libavresample â€” for converting differently sampled audio files to the one used by the TTS voice.

To build the documentation, you need:

1.  the kramdown program to build the general documentation;
2.  the doxygen program to build the api documentation;
3.  the documentation generator project (https://github.com/rhdunn/documentation-generator).

## Building

The Cainteoir Engine supports the standard GNU autotools build system. The
source code does not contain the generated `configure` files, so to build
it you need to run:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make

The tests can be run by using:

	make check

The program can be installed using:

	sudo make install

Source tarballs can be generated by running:

	make dist

To support building the documentation, you need to inform the build where the
[documentation-generator](https://github.com/rhdunn/documentation-generator)
project is located. This can be done by:

	cd ..
	git clone git://github.com/rhdunn/documentation-generator.git
	cd cainteoir-engine
	./configure --with-docgen=../documentation-generator

The documentation can be built by running:

	make doc

Alternatively, just the API documentation can be built by running:

	make api

**NOTE:** You need a recent version of doxygen (such as 1.8.5) that supports
C++11 constructs, specifically scoped enumerations.

## Documentation

The following file formats are supported by Cainteoir Text-to-Speech:

  *  [Voice Database](docs/voicedb-format.md) (`*.vdb`) -- This is the compiled
     format used to define voices used by Cainteoir Text-to-Speech.

  *  [Language Database](docs/langdb-format.md) (`*.ldb`) -- This is the
     compiled format used to define languages used by Cainteoir Text-to-Speech.

### Short Vowels

| Transcription | CXS  | Lexical Set | Examples |
|---------------|------|-------------|----------|
| `/ɪ/`         | `I`  | KIT         | ship, rip, dim, spirit |
| `/ʊ/`         | `U`  | FOOT        | full, look, could |

| `/ɒː/`        | `Q:` | CLOTH       | cough, laurel, origin |

1.  John Wells' lexical sets cover the LONG vowel as part of the CLOTH vowel.
    This transcription assigns the US-specific CLOTH changes under the LONG
    vowel.

#### LOT-CLOTH split

The LOT-CLOTH split is a result of the historic lengthening of the LOT vowel in
CLOTH contexts. As such, it is given the `/ɒː/` transcription to identify it
from the LOT vowel.

| Lexical Set | EMnE   | GenAm | RP     | NRP   |
|-------------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| LOT         | `/ɒ/`  | `/ɑ/` | `/ɒ/`  | `/ɒ/` |
| LONG        | `/ɒ/`  | `/ɔ/` | `/ɒ/`  | `/ɒ/` |
| CLOTH       | `/ɒː/` | `/ɔ/` | `/ɔː/` | `/ɒ/` |

### Syllabic Consonants

| Transcription | CXS  | Examples |
|---------------|------|----------|
| `/l̩/`         | `l=` | bottle   |
| `/m̩/`         | `m=` | rhythm   |
| `/n̩/`         | `n=` | button   |

## Vowels

This transcription of the vowels is based on John Wells' Lexical
Sets<sup>1</sup>.

### Short Vowels

| Transcription | CXS  | Lexical Set | Examples |
|---------------|------|-------------|----------|
| `/ɪ/`         | `I`  | KIT         | ship, rip, dim, spirit |
| `/ʊ/`         | `U`  | FOOT        | full, look, could |
| `/ɛ/`         | `E`  | DRESS       | step, ebb, hem, terror |
| `/ʌ/`         | `V`  | STRUT       | cub, rub, hum |
| `/ɔ/`         | `O`  | LONG<sup>1</sup> | long, frog, chocolate |
| `/æ/`         | `&`  | TRAP        | bad, cab, ham, arrow |
| `/aː/`        | `a:` | BATH        | staff, clasp, dance |
| `/ɒ/`         | `Q`  | LOT         | stop, rob, swan |
| `/ɒː/`        | `Q:` | CLOTH       | cough, laurel, origin |

1.  John Wells' lexical sets cover the LONG vowel as part of the CLOTH vowel.
    This transcription assigns the US-specific CLOTH changes under the LONG
    vowel.

#### LOT-CLOTH split

The LOT-CLOTH split is a result of the historic lengthening of the LOT vowel in
CLOTH contexts. As such, it is given the `/ɒː/` transcription to identify it
from the LOT vowel.

| Lexical Set | EMnE   | GenAm | RP     | NRP   |
|-------------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| LOT         | `/ɒ/`  | `/ɑ/` | `/ɒ/`  | `/ɒ/` |
| LONG        | `/ɒ/`  | `/ɔ/` | `/ɒ/`  | `/ɒ/` |
| CLOTH       | `/ɒː/` | `/ɔ/` | `/ɔː/` | `/ɒ/` |

#### TRAP-BATH split

The TRAP-BATH split is a result of the historic lengthening of the TRAP vowel in
BATH contexts, as well as before historic `/r/` in START contexts.

| Lexical Set | ME     | EMnE    | GenAm  | RP     |
|-------------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| TRAP        | `/a/`  | `/æ/`   | `/æ/`  | `/æ/`  |
| BATH        | `/a/`  | `/aː/`  | `/æ/`  | `/ɑː/` |
| START       | `/ar/` | `/aːɹ/` | `/ɑɹ/` | `/ɑː/` |

### Long Vowels

| Transcription | CXS    | Lexical Set | Examples |
|---------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| `/iː/`        | `i:`   | FLEECE      | seed, key, seize |
| `/uː/`        | `u:`   | GOOSE       | who, group, few |
| `/ɜː/`        | `3:`   | NURSE<sup>1</sup> | term, herd, birth, burn |
| `/ɔː/`        | `O:`   | THOUGHT     | taut, hawk, broad |
| `/ɑː/`        | `A:`   | PALM        | calm, bra, father |

1.  In accents that preserve the historically unmerged FIR-FUR-FERN distinction
    `nurse` is a `FUR` vowel, but the modern sound is a `FERN` sound. Therefore,
    the NURSE vowel is kept to identify the merged and unmerged transcriptions.

### R Vowels

R vowels are vowels that are spelled with an `r` at the end. The `r` was
pronounced upto the 18th century and is still present in American, Scottish
and Irish accents.

| Transcription | CXS    | Lexical Set | Examples |
|---------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| `/ɪr/`        | `Ir`   | FIR<sup>1</sup> | birth, myrrh, mirk |
| `/ʊr/`        | `Ur`   | FUR<sup>1</sup> | burn, hurl, world |
| `/ɛr/`        | `Er`   | FERN<sup>1</sup> | term, herd, earth |
| `/oːr/`       | `o:r`  | NORTH       | war, storm, for, aural |
| `/ɔːr/`       | `O:r`  | FORCE       | floor, coarse, ore, oral |
| `/ɑːr/`       | `A:r`  | START       | far, sharp, farm, safari |

1.  The NURSE lexical set described by John Wells has been split into three
    lexical sets to support Scottish and Irish English.

#### HORSE-HOARSE merger

The THOUGHT vowel before historic `/r/` was pronounced differently in NORTH and
FORCE contexts. This is preserved in some accents, but not in accents that have
the HORSE-HOARSE merger.

| Lexical Set | EMnE      | GenAm  | RP     |
|-------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| THOUGHT     | `/ɔː/`    | `/ɔ/`  | `/ɔː/` |
| NORTH       | `/oːɹ/`   | `/oɹ/` | `/ɔː/` |
| FORCE       | `/ɔːɹ/`   | `/ɔɹ/` | `/ɔː/` |

#### FERN-FIR-FUR merger

The FERN-FIR-FUR merger is the merger of the Middle English `/ɛ/`, `/ɪ/` and
`/ʊ/` before historic `/r/` into the NURSE lexical set. The pre-merged forms
are found in Scottish English and some variants of Irish English.

To properly describe this variation, the NURSE lexical set is split into its
pre-merged FERN, FIR, FUR forms, and the Middle English transcriptions are used
for FIR and FUR.

| Lexical Set | ME     | RP     | ScE    | IrE    |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| FERN        | `/ɛr/` | `/ɜː/` | `/ɛɾ/` | `/ɛɹ/` |
| FIR         | `/ɪr/` | `/ɜː/` | `/ɪɾ/` | `/ɪɹ/` |
| FUR         | `/ʊr/` | `/ɜː/` | `/ʌɾ/` | `/ʊɹ/` |

### Diphthongs

| Transcription | CXS    | Lexical Set | Examples |
|---------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| `/ɪə̯/`        | `I@_^` | NEAR        | beer, pier, fierce, serious |
| `/ʊə̯/`        | `U@_^` | CURE        | poor, tour, fury |
| `/eɪ̯/`        | `eI_^` | FACE        | weight, rein, steak |
| `/əʊ̯/`        | `@U_^` | GOAT        | soap, soul, home |
| `/ɛə̯/`        | `E@_^` | SQUARE      | care, air, wear, Mary |

| `/aʊ̯/`        | `aU_^` | MOUTH       | pouch, noun, crowd, flower |

| `/aʊ̯ə̯/`       | `aU_^@_^` | HOUR<sup>1</sup> | hour |

1.  Triphthongs are not given lexical sets by John Wells.

### Reduced Vowels

| Transcription | CXS       | Lexical Set | Examples |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `/i/`         | `i`       | HAPPY       | silly, Tony, merry |
| `/ɨ/`         | `i\`      | ROSES<sup>1</sup> | roses, emission, braided |
| `/ə/`         | `@`       | COMMA       | China, sofa |
| `/ɚ/`         | ```@` ``` | LETTER      | beggar, martyr, visor |

1.  This reduced vowel is not assigned a lexical set by John Wells. It is
    given one here as it can be realized differently in different accents.

## Syllables

| Transcription | CXS | Description |
|---------------|-----|-------------|
| `/ˈ/`         | `'` | A syllable with primary stress. |
| `/ˌ/`         | `,` | A syllable with secondary stress. |

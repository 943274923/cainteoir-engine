<h1>Document Processing</h1>

<p>Document processing is about handling documents of a given type in a given format. For the purpose of text-to-speech this is any document that can contain text.</p>

<p>There are several areas of document processing that are of interest, and specific tasks that a user may want to perform on the document:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Reading &mdash; this is extracting the text and other information from the document that is of interest;</li>
	<li>Writing &mdash; this is persisting text and other information in a document, for example when the user requests to save the document they have open;</li>
	<li>Viewing &mdash; this is presenting the document to the user such that they can read and navigate through it;</li>
	<li>Printing &mdash; this is rendering the document to a printer device;</li>
	<li>Listening &mdash; this is where the computer speaks out the content of the document to some speakers or headphones;</li>
	<li>Recording &mdash; this is where the computer speaks out the content of the document to an audio file, allowing the user to listen to it on their portable media player;</li>
	<li>Modifying &mdash; this is changing the content of the document, which is useful for pasting text from the clipboard or correcting errors in the document.</li>
</ol>

<p>By creating a generalised model of document content and formatting, adding support for a new document type can be reduced to providing a producer of this content to read a document and a consumer of this content to write the document to a file.</p>

<p>The text-to-speech engine can then handle reading and recording document contents by providing a consumer of the document content.</p>

<p>The viewing and printing support is then handled by a Document Object Model (DOM) with a graphical viewer that renders the content to a screen or printer device. The DOM is constructed by using a DomBuilder that is a consumer of document contents and a DomSerialiser that is a producer of document contents.</p>

<p>The command-line version can skip the DOM generation and bind the text-to-speech engine directly to the correct document reader.</p>

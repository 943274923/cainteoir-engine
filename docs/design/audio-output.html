<h1>Audio Output</h1>

<p>Most text-to-speech programs have limited audio output capabilities. They usually either output to an audio device through a single API such as OSS, ALSA, PortAudio or PulseAudio or to a file in a specific raw format such as wav.</p>

<p>By having the text-to-speech engine write to an audio interface, it is possible to support a larger number of audio APIs and file formats.</p>

<p>The audio API should support the following capabilities:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Creating an audio connection with a specific number of channels, frequency and format;</li>
	<li>Closing a connection;</li>
	<li>Writing raw audio data to the connection;</li>
	<li>Splitting the connection &mdash; this is to support recoding audio over multiple files;</li>
	<li>Writing meta-data to the connection &mdash; this is for files that support meta-data like ogg and flac.</li>
</ol>

<p>At a minimum, the following audio device APIs should be supported:</p>
<ol>
	<li>OSS &mdash; this is to support environments that have either OSSv3 or OSSv4 such as BSD platforms;</li>
	<li>ALSA &mdash; this is to support environments that have an ALSA device such as Linux platforms;</li>
	<li>PulseAudio &mdash; this is to support environments that have a PulseAudio device such as modern Ubuntu platforms.</li>
</ol>
<p>and the following file formats should be supported:</p>
<ol>
	<li>WAV &mdash; writes the data to the Windows Wave audio format;</li>
	<li>OGG+Vorbis &mdash; writes the data to the vorbis audio format in an ogg container with meta-data support;</li>
	<li>FLAC &mdash; writes the data to the FLAC audio format with meta-data support.</li>
</ol>
